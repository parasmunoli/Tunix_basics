# My Hands-On Experience with Tunix  
JAX Native Powers the Future of LLM Tuning  

## Overview  
This repository contains my hands-on exploration of **Tunix**, a JAX-native framework developed by Google that redefines how large language model (LLM) tuning can be performed.  

Tunix integrates multiple tuning strategies into a single unified workflow, making it efficient, scalable, and flexible for researchers and practitioners.  

The work shared here is based on my detailed blog posts:

## Key Highlights  
Tunix simplifies and optimizes LLM tuning by providing:  

1. Unified workflows for fine-tuning, preference alignment, reinforcement learning, and distillation.  
2. Scalability and high performance through the JAX ecosystem.  
3. A forward-looking approach that shows how LLM development will evolve.  

## Repository Contents  
This repository includes:  

1. Jupyter notebooks with practical experiments and demonstrations.  
2. Explanations of how Tunix can be applied across different LLM tuning methods.  
3. Observations, insights, and results from hands-on experimentation.  

## Why This Matters  
The field of LLM tuning is rapidly advancing. By leveraging JAX and frameworks like Tunix, developers and researchers can:  

- Streamline complex tuning processes into a single pipeline.  
- Take advantage of performance gains from JAX-native operations.  
- Experiment with state-of-the-art methods for making LLMs more efficient and aligned.  

## Getting Started
